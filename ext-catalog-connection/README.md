# ext-catalog-connection

Manifest id `io.github.mosaikit.ext.catalog.connection`, package `io.github.mosaikit.ext:ext-catalog-connection`.

The framework of connections to data sources: the list, the creation path, the detail, the source picker the editors of other extensions open, encrypted credentials, the content model and the SQL workspace. Each kind of source is a connector, `ext-catalog-connection-<source>`.

This folder holds everything of the extension and refers to nothing outside it (ADR-0001 of this
repository): it is a project of its own, built and tested like an extension of a third party, only
against what Mosaikit publishes. Its requirements are in [`docs/requirements/`](docs/requirements/),
one `EXT-nnn.md` each, and its changes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `manifest.yaml` | identity, frontend and contributions of the extension |
| `web/index.js` | the app, a custom element the shell renders at `/app/connections` |
| `web/i18n.js` | the texts of the app in English and Italian, chosen by `context.locale` |
| `pom.xml` | the build, on the parent of Mosaikit extensions `io.github.mosaikit:mosaikit-extension-parent` |
| `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/` | the bench of `@mosaikit/testing` and the Playwright tests |
| `docs/requirements/` | the requirements of this extension |

## Build and test

Java 25, Maven and Node.js 24, from this folder:

```bash
mvn package    # target/ext-catalog-connection-0.1.0.zip, the package to install
mvn verify     # also the tests of tests/, on a Mosaikit installation started for them
npm test       # the same tests, after mvn package
npm run dev    # Mosaikit with this extension, until Ctrl+C
```

Until the first release of Mosaikit the extension follows its latest snapshot: the parent POM
`0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `@mosaikit/testing` (`mosaikit-testing-latest.tgz`) come from the pre-release
[`snapshot`](https://github.com/mosaikit/mosaikit/releases/tag/snapshot) of Mosaikit. npm downloads
the bench by itself; Maven needs the parent in the local repository once, either with
`mvn install` in a clone of Mosaikit or from the pre-release:

```bash
snapshot=https://github.com/mosaikit/mosaikit/releases/download/snapshot v=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
for f in mosaikit-parent-$v.pom mosaikit-extension-parent-$v.pom mosaikit-kernel-api-$v.pom mosaikit-kernel-api-$v.jar; do
  curl -fsSLO "$snapshot/$f"
done
mvn -q install:install-file -Dfile=mosaikit-parent-$v.pom -DpomFile=mosaikit-parent-$v.pom -Dpackaging=pom
mvn -q install:install-file -Dfile=mosaikit-extension-parent-$v.pom -DpomFile=mosaikit-extension-parent-$v.pom -Dpackaging=pom
mvn -q install:install-file -Dfile=mosaikit-kernel-api-$v.jar -DpomFile=mosaikit-kernel-api-$v.pom
```

The CI does the same with the action `mosaikit/.github/actions/kernel-api`.
`MOSAIKIT_INSTALLATION=<mosaikit>/target/dist/mosaikit` tests against a build of Mosaikit.
